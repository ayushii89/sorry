    <h1>I'm Really Sorry...</h1>
   <p>hey...

i don’t even know what to say, i just… i’m sorry. like truly, deeply sorry. i’ve been crying since yesterday, i haven’t eaten, i can’t sleep babyyyyy — my heart literally feels so heavy i am so sorry!! babyyy

i know i messed up. i know involving someone else was wrong and it ruined the trust between us. but please believe me when i say i never meant to hurt you. not even for a second.i promise yeh kabhi ni hogayaaaa babyyyyy

i’ve been sitting with everything, and all i keep thinking is how stupid i was to let anything come between us. you’ve always been there for me, always loved me genuinely, and i just feel like i broke something really precious.

but please… please don’t let this be the end of us. i love you seriouslyyyy so muchhh like really love you. more than anything, more than words can even explain. it’s you — it’s always been you babyyyyyyy!!

i know i have to earn back your trust. i know this isn’t just about saying sorry. but i’m ready to do that. i just don’t want to lose you. i don’t want to imagine my days without you in them.

i’m here. hurting, crying, waiting… hoping you’ll see how much i care.

please don’t give up on us.

– yours meri jaan 💔
